Version de java mini: 1.7

v1.0 released

# TODO :

-Find a better way for differenciating function call from
 an ident in the Expression.pushOperand method
(currently, an ugly static flag is doing the job in Yaka.java)

-Change the grammar from defConst = <ident> "=" valConst()
		    to   defConst = <ident> "=" expression()

-Make the code better

-Add any relevant feature (for loops, error/warning handling, etc..)
